The program begins by asking the user for the current year.  This is the number that calculates the category for the 
given player and determines the year of the current season.

The menu is displayed between lines of 67 dashes.  The name of the first player entry is printed above the first line of dashes.  
Below the first line of dashes, a menu of commands is displayed.  Below that menu, the prompt "Please Select a Choice: " is displayed.  
The user types the first letter of a command, the command executes and everything is redisplayed.  Some commands prompt the user for more information.  

Here is a description of the various commands:

Full List: asks the user for a category and filename and outputs all the players in that category to the given filename.

Search Player: asks the user for the name of a player, displays that player.

Add Player: asks the user for name, year of birth, (category is calculated based on year of birth and current year), and registration status.

Edit Player: similar to Add command, except edits a current player instead of adding a new player to the database.

New Season: asks the user if they want to delete the current season and start a new one. If yes, a backup will be created.

quit: Stops the program.
