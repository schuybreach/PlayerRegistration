# PlayerRegistration
This was a school project for a CS142 class - written in C++

The assignment was to create a player registration application for youth soccer. 

At the time (Spring 2017), it work and ran well - I believe I received an A or 100 on the project, though I can't quite remember.

But more recently, trying to run the project again, I've been running into some issues, which I think stem from compliling problems. It's an old project, so I'm not going to spend too much time looking into it. I just know that it did work as assigned during the class.
